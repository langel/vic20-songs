*notes on emulators*

VIC20 by default only has RIGHT and DOWN arrow keys.
Pressing either SHIFT will reverse the direction of these keys.
winVICE (emulator) automagically adds shift when using the 4 arrow keys.
Modern PC keyboard TAB == RESTORE key
Modern PC keyboard LEFT_CTRL == COMMODORE key

Many other keys do not directly map between the two keyboards.
  example quotes " are SHIFT-2
